# Directional Button Logger

This web application captures clicks on directional buttons and displays the log entries in a temporary overlay at the bottom of the screen. Each log shows the last three interactions and disappears after 7 seconds.

## How It's Made

The application is structured using:

- **HTML**: Sets up the directional buttons and the log display area.
- **CSS**: Styles the buttons and the log container to seamlessly integrate with the website's design.
- **JavaScript**: Adds functionality to the buttons for capturing clicks and displaying logs dynamically.
- **PHP/MySQL**: Manages the recording of each button click in the database and retrieves the last three logs for display.
